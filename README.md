# How-To

## Create or edit the UI from scratch

1) Create a blank node-js project Dockerfile recipe.

This is current Dockerfile except line "ADD" and "npm install".

2) Run it with mapping folder where project will be created:

```bash
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/src/ti-dhome:/opt/ti-dhome kalemena/ti-dhome-ui bash
$$ vue init webpack .
```

$$ npm install vue-awesome-swiper --save
```

```
